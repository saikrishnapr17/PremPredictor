## Introduction
The Premier League is one of the most popular football leagues globally. This project explores historical match data to:
- Identify performance trends of teams.
- Predict match outcomes using statistical models.
- Visualize key metrics such as goals scored, win rates, and more.

## Dataset
The dataset used for this project is `premier-league-matches.csv`, which contains the following key columns:
- `Date`: The date of the match.
- `HomeTeam` and `AwayTeam`: Teams involved in the match.
- `FTHG` and `FTAG`: Full-time home and away goals.
- `FTR`: Full-time result (H: Home win, D: Draw, A: Away win).

## Features
1. **Data Cleaning and Preprocessing**: Handled missing values and ensured data quality.
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**:
   - Visualizations of team performance over time.
   - Analysis of goals scored, goals conceded, and win rates.
3. **Prediction Models**:
   - Built machine learning models to predict match outcomes.
4. **Interactive Visualizations**:
   - Created plots and dashboards for better understanding.

## Future
1. Expand the analysis to include player-level statistics.
2. Incorporate live match data for real-time predictions.
3. Improve prediction models using advanced techniques (e.g., neural networks).
